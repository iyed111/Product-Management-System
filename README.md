A fully functional product management system that allows users to manage products dynamically. This project demonstrates the use of modern JavaScript features and localStorage for data persistence.

## Features
- **Add Products**: Enter details like price, taxes, ads, discounts, etc.
- **Calculate Totals**: Automatically calculate the total price based on input.
- **Manage Products**: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
- **Category Search**: Search products by title or category.
- **Local Storage**: Save product data in the browser's local storage for persistence.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile views.

## **CSV Functionality**

The system includes a feature to export product data to a **CSV file**, which can be used for further analysis or reporting.

*. Export Data:
     - The CSV file includes the following columns:
     - **ID**: Unique identifier for each product.
     - **Title**: Name of the product.
     - **Price**: Price of the product.
     - **Taxes**: Taxes applied to the product.
     - **Ads**: Advertising costs for the product.
     - **Discount**: Discount applied to the product.
     - **Total**: Total price after calculations.
     - **Category**: Category of the product.

   - The exported CSV file can be opened in spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or any data analysis tool.
      It is particularly useful for generating reports, performing data analysis, or sharing data with stakeholders.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic functionality and logic.
